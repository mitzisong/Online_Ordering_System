ONLINE ORDERING SYSTEM for Mitzi's Cupcakes
======================
An Online Ordering System was created for a pseudo bakery named Mitzi's Cupcakes. If the option is available, most customers would prefer placing an order through an online ordering system rather than holding a frustrating conversation over the phone or even a back-and-forth email dance. Mitzi's Cupcakes' Online Ordering System utilizes Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Postgres, HTML, CSS, Javascript/jQuery, and WTForms.
